**Created**: 2025-11-19
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Patient merge functionality allowing Global Administrators to consolidate duplicate patient records into a single authoritative patient identity, maintaining complete data history, FHIR R4 compliance using Patient link functionality, and comprehensive audit trail"

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### User Story 1 - Merge Duplicate Patient Records (Priority: P1)

A Global Administrator discovers two patient records that represent the same person due to duplicate registration. They need to consolidate all clinical and administrative data into a single authoritative patient record while preserving complete data history and maintaining FHIR compliance.

**Why this priority**: Duplicate patient records compromise data integrity, fragment clinical history, and can lead to medical errors. The ability to merge duplicates is essential for maintaining accurate patient records and ensuring complete clinical context for diagnosis and treatment decisions.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating two patient records with associated orders, results, and samples, executing the merge workflow through all steps, and verifying that all data is consolidated under the primary patient with proper FHIR linking and complete audit trail.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am a Global Administrator on the Merge Patient screen, **When** I click "Select Patient" buttons, **Then** the existing patient search modal opens and allows me to search and select patients
2. **Given** I have selected two different patients, **When** I proceed to the next step, **Then** I see the primary patient selection screen with full demographic and clinical summaries for both patients in expandable accordions
3. **Given** I am on the primary patient selection screen, **When** I select one patient as primary via radio button, **Then** the system highlights which demographics will be preserved and shows data consolidation summary
4. **Given** I proceed to the confirmation screen, **When** I review the merge summary, **Then** I see total counts of orders, results, samples, documents, and audit entries being consolidated, plus any conflicting demographic information
5. **Given** I am on the confirmation screen, **When** I check the confirmation checkbox and provide a reason for merge, **Then** the "Confirm Merge" button becomes enabled
6. **Given** I click "Confirm Merge", **When** the merge operation completes successfully, **Then** I see a success message with the primary patient ID and options to view the patient or merge another pair
7. **Given** the merge is complete, **When** I view the primary patient record, **Then** I see all consolidated data (orders, results, samples) and both patient identifiers preserved
8. **Given** the merge is complete, **When** I attempt to access the merged patient record directly, **Then** the system shows it is inactive and provides a link to the primary patient record

---

### User Story 2 - Real-Time Notification for Active Sessions (Priority: P1)

A laboratory technician is actively viewing a patient record or entering results when a Global Administrator merges that patient with another record. The technician needs immediate notification that the displayed data has changed so they can reload to see current information.

**Why this priority**: Without real-time notification, users could continue working with stale patient data after a merge, potentially entering results or orders against an inactive patient record. This is P1 because it prevents data integrity issues and user confusion.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by having one user view a patient record while another Global Administrator merges that patient, verifying that the viewing user receives an immediate notification banner with reload option.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am viewing a patient record or results entry screen, **When** a Global Administrator merges this patient with another, **Then** I immediately see a warning notification banner at the top of the page
2. **Given** the merge notification appears, **When** I read the message, **Then** it clearly states "This patient record has been merged" and provides a "Reload Page" button
3. **Given** I click the "Reload Page" button, **When** the page refreshes, **Then** I am redirected to the primary patient record with current consolidated data
4. **Given** I was viewing the merged (non-primary) patient, **When** I reload, **Then** I see the primary patient record instead with all merged data visible

---

### User Story 3 - View Audit Trail with Merge Indicators (Priority: P2)

A laboratory supervisor is reviewing historical audit entries for quality assurance or compliance purposes. When viewing entries related to a patient who was later merged, they need clear indication of the merge relationship to maintain proper context.

**Why this priority**: Audit trail clarity is important for compliance and investigation, but the core merge functionality (P1) can operate without enhanced audit display. This is P2 because it improves usability and compliance reporting without blocking basic merge operations.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by merging two patients with existing audit entries, then viewing the audit trail and verifying that entries for the merged patient show an indicator linking to the primary patient.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am viewing the audit trail, **When** I see an entry for a patient who was later merged, **Then** the patient ID is displayed with a merge indicator icon (ⓘ)
2. **Given** I see a merge indicator on an audit entry, **When** I hover over the icon, **Then** a tooltip appears stating "This patient record was merged into [PRIMARY-ID] on [DATE]"
3. **Given** I click on a merged patient ID with indicator, **When** the link activates, **Then** I navigate to the primary patient record
4. **Given** I am viewing audit entries for the primary patient after a merge, **When** I look at the timeline, **Then** I see entries from both original patients in chronological order with their original patient IDs preserved

---

### Edge Cases

- **What happens when attempting to merge a patient with itself?** The system validates that the two selected patients must have different IDs and displays an error message "Cannot merge a patient with itself" if the same patient is selected twice.

- **How does the system handle merging patients who have already been merged?** The system checks the `is_merged` flag on both patients and displays an error "One or both patients have already been merged" if either patient has `is_merged = TRUE`, preventing cascading merges.

- **What happens if two Global Administrators attempt to merge the same patients simultaneously?** The system uses database row locking (`SELECT ... FOR UPDATE`) on both patient records at the start of the merge transaction, causing the second administrator's attempt to wait until the first completes, then displaying "A merge operation is already in progress for one of these patients."

- **How does the system handle patients with conflicting demographic information?** The system preserves the demographics of the selected primary patient and displays all conflicts (phone, email, address) in the confirmation screen with a note that "Primary patient demographics will be used." All identifiers from both patients are preserved.

- **What happens to active lab orders and pending results during a merge?** All active orders, pending results, and in-progress samples are reassigned to the primary patient via foreign key updates. Users with these items open receive real-time notifications to reload their screens.

- **How does the system handle performance with patients who have 500+ results?** For merges involving patients with combined total >200 results, the system displays a performance warning "This merge involves a large amount of data (500+ results). The operation may take up to 30 seconds to complete" and shows a progress indicator during the operation.

- **What happens if the FHIR synchronization fails after a successful database merge?** The system logs a critical error, notifies the Global Administrator with "Patients were merged but FHIR synchronization encountered an error. Please contact support", and creates an alert for technical staff to manually reconcile FHIR resources.

- **How does the system handle external system integrations after a merge?** If FHIR messaging is configured for external systems, the system sends a Patient merge notification following FHIR R4 specifications with both the `replaces` and `replaced-by` link relationships to inform downstream systems.

- **What happens to patient relationships (e.g., family links, guarantors) during a merge?** The system updates both `patient_id` and `related_patient_id` columns in the `patient_relations` table to point to the primary patient, preserving all relationship mappings with audit trail logging.

- **How does the system prevent circular merge references?** The validation logic checks that neither patient already has a `merged_into_patient_id` value pointing to the other patient, preventing circular references and ensuring a clean merge chain.
